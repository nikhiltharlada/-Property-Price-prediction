#Property Price Prediction




This project focuses on predicting property prices in various districts of California using
several district-level features. By building a predictive model, we aim to identify key variables
that influence housing prices and improve the accuracy of house value predictions. The
project will specifically utilize simple linear regression and multiple linear regression to
address this regression task, ensuring proper data handling and evaluation of the models.
